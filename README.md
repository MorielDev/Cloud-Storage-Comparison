    GCP Vertex AI: Unified AI platform with pre-trained models (Vision, NLP) and AutoML.

        Use Case: Twitter uses Vertex AI to moderate harmful content in real time.

    Azure Machine Learning: Drag-and-drop ML studio with Azure Cognitive Services (e.g., speech recognition).

        Use Case: UPS optimizes delivery routes using Azure ML.

4. Global Infrastructure

    AWS: 33 regions, 105 Availability Zones, and 400+ edge locations (CloudFront CDN).

    GCP: 40 regions, 121 zones, and 146+ edge nodes.

    Azure: 60+ regions, 116 Availability Zones, and 200+ edge sites.

5. Security & Compliance

    AWS: Offers 143 security standards (HIPAA, GDPR) and AWS Shield for DDoS protection.

    GCP: Uses Titanium security chips and Confidential Computing for data encryption.

    Azure: Azure Active Directory (AAD) and Sentinel for identity management and threat detection.

Real-World Applications
1. AWS in Media Streaming

Netflix migrated to AWS in 2016 to handle its global streaming demand. By leveraging:

    EC2 for scalable compute.

    S3 for storing video content.

    Lambda for serverless encoding workflows.
    AWS’s scalability allows Netflix to deploy updates across 1,000+ microservices daily.

2. GCP in Data Analytics

Spotify uses GCP’s BigQuery to analyze 600 million+ user playlists. Key workflows include:

    Real-time song recommendation algorithms.

    Storage of 100+ TB of streaming logs in Cloud Storage.

    Cost savings of 50% compared to on-prem solutions.

3. Azure in Automotive IoT

BMW built its ConnectedDrive platform on Azure to:

    Process 1 billion+ daily data points from vehicles.

    Use Azure IoT Hub for real-time telemetry.

    Deploy predictive maintenance models with Azure Machine Learning.
